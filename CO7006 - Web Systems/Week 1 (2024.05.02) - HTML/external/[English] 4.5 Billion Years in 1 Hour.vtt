00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.667
Earth is 4.5 billion years old – impossible
for your brain to truly grasp, so here is an experiment:

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:14.885
every second around 1.5 million years
will pass – you're on a musical train ride

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:19.387
looking out the window, passing all of
Earth's History in an hour.

00:00:19.387 --> 00:00:25.057
Watch the eons pass and experience
how long a billion years really is.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:30.000
You can have this in the background, study
with it or just enjoy the ride.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.150
From time to time, I’ll say a few words.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.323
4.5 billion years ago, right after it was
born, Earth was a hell of lava…

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.793
Pretty early in its history, Earth collides
with a Mars sized object called Theia,

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:50.517
which forms the moon that you now see in the sky.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.230
Right now it looks huge in the night sky and
will slowly shrink over hundreds of millions

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.300
of years as it orbits further away.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.930
4.5 Billion Years Ago we are in the first eon of our planet, the Hadean, named after the greek god of the underworld.

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:39.110
At this point the Atmosphere is mostly CO2
and the floor is lava.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.427
This area of earth's history is mostly invisible
to us because almost none of it is left.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.463
90 million years have passed.

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:11.595
We are still in the lava hell phase.

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:15.002
Settle in, this will take a while.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:52.893
Although you wouldn't think it, we found
minerals called zircons that indicate

00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:56.004
there may have been some
water around at this time.

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:53.380
During this period of the young solar system,
Earth and the inner solar system are smashed

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.868
by a constant heavy asteroid bombardment,
for several hundred million years.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:19.639
At this point in time, our Sun is 30% less
bright than it is today but there are so many

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.222
greenhouse gases that it's
still much hot and comfy.

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:21.275
Around this time we think
life begins to enter the stage.

00:08:21.275 --> 00:08:27.729
Only a few hundred million years after the
beginning of everything the first cells begin

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:31.865
spreading over our still very deadly planet.

00:08:37.528 --> 00:08:42.501
Earth continues to cool and it probably
rains for millions of years

00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:47.523
as our oceans begin to form, covering
the still young planet with water.

00:12:43.861 --> 00:12:49.910
These hydrothermal vents we're looking at,
and where hot minerals emerge, may have been

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.000
the place where life first developed,
but we dont know.

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:22.816
So much time has passed and we are entering
the Paleoarchean.

00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:29.003
Most of Earth is still underwater while the
first supercontinents are in the making

00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:30.399
in the depths below.

00:13:31.188 --> 00:13:35.552
Its days are shorter since the
young Earth spins faster.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.175
Good job if you are still watching.

00:13:45.175 --> 00:13:47.746
You witnessed a billion years so far.

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:56.680
From this time in history we still have Stromatolites,
sedimentary rocks built by microorganisms.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.493
Among our first real evidence of life on Earth.

00:18:00.493 --> 00:18:08.372
Also life is starting to eat the sun – photosynthesis
might have started as early as around here.

00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:41.696
3.2 Billion Years Ago in the Mesoarchean the
era of continents begins.

00:18:42.245 --> 00:18:48.630
Tectonic plates begin to crush into each other,
pulling and pushing some deep into the earth

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.949
where they dissolve.

00:18:50.498 --> 00:18:53.175
The basis for our continents today.

00:18:54.754 --> 00:19:03.600
The oceans are as hot as a hottub, over 40°C
and microbes are expanding everywhere.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:10.809
We don't have plants yet to consume greenhouse
gases, so it is really, really hot.

00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:14.247
You would basically die immediately
in this atmosphere.

00:19:14.247 --> 00:19:18.000
Also there is no oxygen
in the atmosphere yet.

00:23:51.124 --> 00:23:55.420
2.8 Billion Years Ago the Neoarchean begins.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:02.216
Earth is still a terribly hostile place but
because we finally have proper plate tectonics,

00:24:02.216 --> 00:24:08.380
more chemicals are mixed in from inside the
earth and life can use them to make new things!

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:40.100
Some time around here Prokaryotes like bacteria
begin colonizing the planet.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.000
Life diversifies more and more.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.666
But still, after so much time,
we only have single cells.

00:27:46.868 --> 00:27:52.402
2.5 Billion Years Ago in the Siderian,
a massive event is about to begin

00:27:52.402 --> 00:27:57.809
that will change the planet forever:
The Great Oxidation Event.

00:27:57.809 --> 00:28:03.632
Oxygen, burped out by cyanobacteria reaches
the atmosphere in large quantities,

00:28:03.632 --> 00:28:06.914
paving the way for more complex life.

00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:44.455
All the new oxygen in the air reacts with
methane and forms CO2 and Water,

00:29:44.455 --> 00:29:47.059
which rapidly cools the planet down.

00:30:16.021 --> 00:30:21.144
Probably for the first time ever, the planet
freezes over and a period of multiple

00:30:21.144 --> 00:30:25.151
ice ages begins lasting millions of years.

00:30:27.117 --> 00:30:31.076
2.3 Billion Years Ago the Rhyacian begins.

00:31:14.292 --> 00:31:20.123
Lots of volcanos heat up earth and
earth unfreezes slowly again.

00:31:20.123 --> 00:31:27.159
Melting ice flushes toxic elements into the
oceans but life quietly puts up resistance

00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:28.993
and keeps evolving.

00:33:48.894 --> 00:33:56.250
Some time 2.05 Billion Years Ago in the Orosirian
a large asteroid hits earth and creates the

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.348
largest verified impact structure on Earth.

00:34:47.308 --> 00:34:52.688
All over Earth great mountain ranges are
crushed into existence by early continents

00:34:52.688 --> 00:34:56.851
with wild names like Ur, Nena or Atlantica.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.814
1.8 Billion Years Ago in the Statherian
the supercontinent Columbia has formed.

00:37:06.674 --> 00:37:11.058
And a natural, self sustaining
nuclear reactor awakes,

00:37:11.058 --> 00:37:14.491
just from scattered uranium
deposits in the ground.

00:39:37.664 --> 00:39:44.229
1.6 billion years ago, around the edge of
Calimmian, + or - a few hundred million years or so,

00:39:44.229 --> 00:39:50.313
the first Eukaryotic cells, cells with
a nucleus, merge from two other cells.

00:39:50.313 --> 00:39:54.850
One of the most important
moments in the history of life.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:59.030
But yes, kind of looks not that impressive.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.836
Still, life is only cells.

00:41:35.523 --> 00:41:41.531
Earth's crust thickens and heavy continents
form, the oceans become shallower.

00:41:42.172 --> 00:41:48.585
Also the first fungi-like organisms extent
their tubular arms and do fungi things.

00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:23.530
Some time in the Ectasian 1.4 Billion Years
Ago, Earths inner core is forming.

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:27.834
Weird, right? Feels like it should be older.

00:42:27.834 --> 00:42:34.575
But around here it begins to solidify into
a iron crystal surrounded by hot liquid metal.

00:42:34.575 --> 00:42:36.845
It will only grow from now on.

00:44:53.786 --> 00:44:58.546
1.2 Billion Years Ago in the Stenian not that
much is going on.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:05.100
Except, the algae Bangiomorpha
pubescens might have invented sex.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.114
A big reproductive improvement
for many different reasons.

00:47:33.513 --> 00:47:41.166
1 Billion Years Ago the Tonian begins, another
age where Earth is rocks and puddles and oceans.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.650
Life is still invisible to the naked eye.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:49.101
It does feel different to
witness it like that, right?

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.202
Not everybody is having a great time here.

00:50:11.026 --> 00:50:16.437
We have evidence of the first unicellular
predators emerging around that time.

00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:21.711
The dominance of bacteria ends and big boy
eukaryotes plant their flags in the oceans.

00:50:21.711 --> 00:50:29.031
An arms race between microbes begins that
again creates huge diversity.

00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:31.751
Some even invent tiny armour.

00:51:14.414 --> 00:51:20.380
720 Million Years Ago in the Cryogenian
Earth freezes over again.

00:51:21.073 --> 00:51:22.710
Sure why not.

00:51:23.225 --> 00:51:25.255
How did life survive?

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:26.837
We are not sure.

00:52:19.357 --> 00:52:24.598
635 Million Years Ago the supercontinent
Gondwana forms.

00:52:24.598 --> 00:52:26.848
A lot of it is still left today!

00:53:15.079 --> 00:53:17.510
Wow! What's happening?

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.750
Suddenly life gets big!

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:24.010
In a hot second multicellular
organisms become widespread!

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:30.289
It's all strange aliens still, but can you
imagine that it took that long for this to happen?

00:53:35.301 --> 00:53:40.410
539 Million Years Ago the
Cambrian explosion begins.

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:43.642
We see life bursting with variety.

00:53:43.642 --> 00:53:49.599
Ancestors of almost all of today's major animal
groups appear here while the plants start

00:53:49.599 --> 00:53:51.506
to discover the land.

00:53:51.506 --> 00:53:53.830
Life is finally exciting!

00:53:54.825 --> 00:54:00.343
But of course a big mass extinction happens
right after, killing most species in the ocean.

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:07.450
Plants spread over the planet and create the
soil on the ground and change the atmosphere

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:09.082
by eating CO2.

00:55:38.683 --> 00:55:40.634
Things escalate.

00:55:40.634 --> 00:55:44.764
Flora and fauna adapt better
and better to life on land.

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:51.493
We get trees and forrests, fish and the
first vertebrate decide this land thing

00:55:51.493 --> 00:55:53.665
is something they need to try out!

00:55:56.719 --> 00:56:03.471
359 Million Years Ago in the Carboniferous
forests and lush marshlands are at their peak.

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:10.486
They will turn into the coal humanity burns
today to keep ourselves warm.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.236
Its all so fast now!

00:56:14.236 --> 00:56:18.202
Life changes so quickly
in geological timeframes!

00:56:42.939 --> 00:56:50.151
Some 299 Million Years Ago in the Permian,
Pangea, the last supercontinent has formed.

00:56:50.151 --> 00:56:56.460
And after a few tens of million years, the
largest mass extinction in history happens,

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.715
killing the majority of all species.

00:56:58.715 --> 00:57:00.564
Thanks volcanoes.

00:57:23.077 --> 00:57:27.301
252 Million Years Ago the Triassic begins.

00:57:41.096 --> 00:57:43.081
Oh hey, a dinosaur!

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.668
We are now truly in the age of reptiles.

00:58:05.668 --> 00:58:07.559
Dinosaurs are everywhere!

00:58:08.383 --> 00:58:12.342
The ancestors of the birds do bird things.

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:15.714
Life, uhh, finds a way!

00:59:20.404 --> 00:59:22.929
Earth gets more and more familiar.

00:59:38.526 --> 00:59:40.347
Such a paradise.

00:59:40.347 --> 00:59:42.000
Life is thriving.

00:59:43.496 --> 00:59:47.568
Nothing can go wrong... wait, what's that?

00:59:50.416 --> 00:59:54.436
And an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and
most species on Earth.

00:59:54.883 --> 00:59:56.204
Such a bummer.

00:59:57.405 --> 01:00:00.640
66 Million Years Ago in the Paleogene

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:05.980
the continents look roughly the same as today
and mammals take over.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.197
It is our time now!

01:00:09.055 --> 01:00:11.363
We are almost home.

01:00:39.755 --> 01:00:43.564
Don't blink or you might miss
all of human history!

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.480
And that was it.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.410
Earth is ancient.

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:51.390
We are new.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.359
So new.

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:55.191
This was a project born of passion.

01:00:55.191 --> 01:01:01.077
We've worked on this video on and off since
2019 and as you can imagine, it took forever to make.

01:01:01.077 --> 01:01:04.069
But we did we finished it in time
for our tenth10 year anniversary.
